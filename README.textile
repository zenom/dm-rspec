RSpec2 matchers for DataMapper.

h1. Usage

You must include DataMapperMatchers to your specs. It can be done in *spec/spec_helper.rb*:

Based off the dm-spec matchers by "Botanicus":http://github.com/botanicus/dm-spec.

Use these matchers in your specs. All the matchers you should call on model class, not on model instance.

<pre>
Post.should has_property :title, String, :default => "", :required => true
Comment.should belongs_to(:post)
Post.has_many(:comments)
Post.has_one(:user)
Post.should has_and_belongs_to_many(:tags)
Post.should has_timestamps      # created_at, updated_at
Post.should has_timestamps(:at) # created_at, updated_at
Post.should has_timestamps(:on) # created_on, updated_on
Post.should has_timestamps(:created_at)
</pre>
